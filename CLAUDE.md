# Scarf — macOS GUI for the Hermes AI Agent

## Project Structure

```
scarf/scarf/           Xcode project root (PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup — auto-discovers files)
  scarf/               Main app target source
    Core/Services/     HermesDataService, HermesFileService, HermesLogService, ACPClient, HermesFileWatcher
    Core/Models/       Plain structs: HermesSession, HermesMessage, HermesConfig, etc.
    Features/          MVVM-F feature modules (Dashboard, Sessions, Activity, Chat, Memory, Skills, Cron, Logs, Settings)
    Navigation/        AppCoordinator, SidebarView
  docs/                PRD, Architecture, Discovery notes
  standards/           Copied development standards (read-only reference)
```

## Architecture Rules

- **MVVM-F**: Features never import sibling features. Cross-feature goes through services.
- **AppCoordinator**: Single `@Observable` coordinator for all navigation state, injected via `.environment()`.
- **No external dependencies**: System SQLite3, Foundation JSON, AttributedString markdown.
- **Read-only DB access**: Never write to `~/.hermes/state.db`. Only write to memory files and cron jobs.
- **Sandbox disabled**: App reads `~/.hermes/` directly.
- **Swift 6 concurrency**: `@MainActor` default. Services use `nonisolated` + async/await.

## Design System (ScarfDesign)

All app UI uses the typed token bundle in [scarf/Packages/ScarfDesign/](scarf/Packages/ScarfDesign/) — both the `scarf` and `scarf mobile` targets `import ScarfDesign`. Reach for these tokens before inventing new colors, fonts, or spacings.

- **Colors**: `ScarfColor.accent`, `.foregroundPrimary/Muted/Faint`, `.backgroundPrimary/Secondary/Tertiary`, `.border/.borderStrong`, `.success/.danger/.warning/.info`, `.Tool.bash/edit/search/web/think`. All resolve from `ScarfBrand.xcassets` and adapt light/dark automatically.
- **Typography**: `.scarfStyle(.title2)`, `.scarfStyle(.body)`, `.scarfStyle(.captionUppercase)`, etc. Use these instead of `.font(.system(...))`. Eleven preset styles cover the type scale.
- **Spacing / radius / shadow**: `ScarfSpace.s1...s10` (4/8/12/16/20/24/32/40), `ScarfRadius.sm/md/lg/xl/xxl/pill`, `.scarfShadow(.sm/.md/.lg/.xl)`. Hardcoded `.padding(12)` or `cornerRadius: 8` is a code smell — convert.
- **Components**: `ScarfPageHeader("Title", subtitle: "...") { trailing }`, `ScarfCard { ... }`, `ScarfBadge("text", kind: .success)`, `ScarfTextField`, `ScarfSectionHeader`, `ScarfDivider`, `ScarfPrimaryButton/SecondaryButton/GhostButton/DestructiveButton` (apply with `.buttonStyle(...)`).
- **App icon + accent**: `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` is the rust set; `Assets.xcassets/AccentColor.colorset` resolves `Color.accentColor` to rust so any unmigrated SwiftUI control still tints correctly.
- **Reference**: full screen mockups live at `design/static-site/ui-kit/*.jsx` (open `design/static-site/index.html` in a browser). The `ScarfChatView.ChatRootView` reference component in the package is a 3-pane chat redesign target — usable for previews but not yet swapped into the live chat (the existing `RichChatView` machinery still owns the real ACP pipeline).
- **Don't**: introduce purple/violet tones (we shifted to rust); use yellow `#F0AD4E` for success (that's `.warning` — `.success` is green); bypass the type scale with `.font(.system(size: 13.5))`; ship terminal/syntax-highlight palettes through ScarfColor (those are content semantics, keep them inline).

### iOS Dynamic Type policy

iOS users can scale text via Settings → Accessibility → Display & Text Size. ScarfFont uses fixed point sizes; adopting it blanket on iOS would regress accessibility on `.accessibility2` / `.xSmall` users. iOS-specific rule:

- **Use `ScarfFont` only for**: status badges, chip labels, intentional-display elements (e.g., onboarding step titles, header chrome that's meant to be a fixed visual size).
- **Keep `.font(.headline)` / `.body` / `.caption` semantic tokens for**: list-row primary + secondary text, body copy, error messages, chat content — anything the user reads.

Decision tree per text element: "is this read for content?" → semantic token. "Is this chrome / a label / a badge?" → ScarfFont.

Mac doesn't have this constraint and adopts ScarfFont everywhere. The iOS app already clamps Dynamic Type at the scene root (`ScarfIOSApp.swift`: `.dynamicTypeSize(.xSmall ... .accessibility2)`) — keep that.

### iOS page chrome

Don't retrofit `ScarfPageHeader` over iOS tab roots. iOS uses `.navigationTitle(...)` + `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.large)` as its native page-header pattern; stacking ScarfPageHeader on top creates double titles. Use ScarfPageHeader only on iOS sub-views without a native large-title bar (rare).

iOS button styling: only swap `.borderedProminent` → `ScarfPrimaryButton`. **Leave `.bordered` native** — it's the iOS convention and inherits rust through `AccentColor.colorset` automatically. Same for `.plain` (used as compact tap targets in lists).

## Key Paths

- Hermes home: `~/.hermes/`
- SQLite DB: `~/.hermes/state.db` (WAL mode, read-only)
- Config: `~/.hermes/config.yaml`
- Memory: `~/.hermes/memories/MEMORY.md`, `~/.hermes/memories/USER.md`
- Sessions: `~/.hermes/sessions/session_*.json`
- Cron: `~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`
- Logs: `~/.hermes/logs/errors.log`, `~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log`
- ACP: `hermes acp` subprocess (stdio JSON-RPC)

## Build

```bash
xcodebuild -project scarf/scarf.xcodeproj -scheme scarf -configuration Debug build
```

## Releases

Shipped via a single local script. **Never run manual `xcodebuild archive` / `notarytool` / `gh release create` steps — use the script so nothing is skipped or misordered.**

```bash
./scripts/release.sh <version>           # full release: notarize → appcast → gh-pages → tag
./scripts/release.sh <version> --draft   # draft: everything builds + notarizes, but appcast/tag are skipped
```

The script bumps version, archives Universal (arm64 + x86_64) + ARM64-only variants, signs with Developer ID, notarizes via `xcrun notarytool` (keychain profile `scarf-notary`), staples, EdDSA-signs the appcast entry with Sparkle's key, pushes the appcast to `gh-pages`, and creates a GitHub release with both zips attached. Draft mode stops after the release is uploaded so the current version stays "latest" until explicitly promoted.

**Release notes convention:** write them to `releases/v<version>/RELEASE_NOTES.md` BEFORE running the script — it's auto-included in the version-bump commit and used as the GitHub release body. If absent, a placeholder is used.

**Canonical prompts (any of these trigger the flow):**
- "Release v1.6.2" — full release
- "Release v1.6.2 as draft" — draft mode
- "Prepare v1.6.2 release notes from recent commits, then release" — generate notes first, then run

**Prerequisites (one-time, already set up on Alan's machine):** Developer ID Application cert in login Keychain (team `3Q6X2L86C4`), notarytool keychain profile `scarf-notary`, Sparkle EdDSA private key in Keychain item `https://sparkle-project.org`, `gh-pages` branch + GitHub Pages enabled. See the header of [scripts/release.sh](scripts/release.sh) and the Releases section in [README.md](README.md) for details.

## Wiki

Public documentation lives in the GitHub wiki at https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/wiki. The wiki is a separate git repo cloned to `.wiki-worktree/` in the repo root (gitignored, sibling to `.gh-pages-worktree/`). Internal dev notes stay in `scarf/docs/`; the wiki is for public-facing reference.

**Update the wiki when:**
- A new feature module is added under `scarf/scarf/scarf/Features/` → extend the relevant User Guide page.
- A new core service is added under `Core/Services/` → extend `Core-Services.md`.
- Architecture changes (AppCoordinator, transport, MVVM-F rule, sandbox) → `Architecture-Overview.md` + the specific sub-page.
- Hermes version bumps in this file → `Hermes-Version-Compatibility.md`.
- `scripts/release.sh` completes a full (non-draft) release → bump latest-version on `Home.md` + append to `Release-Notes-Index.md`.
- Keyboard shortcut or sidebar section changes → `Keyboard-Shortcuts.md` / `Sidebar-and-Navigation.md`.

**Skip for:** bug fixes with no user-observable change, pure refactors, typos, test-only changes, internal cleanups.

```bash
./scripts/wiki.sh pull                         # always first
# edit .wiki-worktree/*.md with normal tools
./scripts/wiki.sh commit "docs: describe X"   # runs secret-scan
./scripts/wiki.sh push                         # runs secret-scan again, then push
```

**Never** commit API keys, tokens, `.env` files, private keys, or real hostnames/IPs to the wiki. The script's two-pass secret-scan blocks common token patterns and a user-maintained blocklist at `scripts/wiki-blocklist.txt` (gitignored). Do not bypass without explicit approval. Full workflow on the wiki itself at `.wiki-worktree/Wiki-Maintenance.md`.

## Hermes Version

Targets Hermes v2026.4.30 (v0.12.0). Log lines may carry an optional `[session_id]` tag between the level and logger name — `HermesLogService.parseLine` treats the session tag as an optional capture group, so older untagged lines still parse.

**Capability gating.** Scarf detects the target's Hermes version once per server connection via [HermesCapabilities](scarf/Packages/ScarfCore/Sources/ScarfCore/Services/HermesCapabilities.swift) (`hermes --version` → semver + `YYYY.M.D` parse). The resulting `HermesCapabilitiesStore` is injected on `ContextBoundRoot` (Mac) and `ScarfGoTabRoot` (iOS) via `.environment(_:)` and `.hermesCapabilities(_:)`; UI that depends on a v0.12+ surface (Curator, Kanban, ACP image input, `auxiliary.curator`, `prompt_caching.cache_ttl`, Piper TTS, Vercel terminal) reads it through the typed environment key. Pre-v0.12 hosts gracefully hide the new affordances rather than throwing on unknown CLI subcommands. Add a new flag at the top of `HermesCapabilities` whenever Scarf gains a release-gated UI surface.

**v2026.4.30 (v0.12.0)** added (Scarf-relevant subset):

- **Autonomous Curator** — `hermes curator` self-prunes / -consolidates the skill library on a 7-day cycle. Reports land at `~/.hermes/logs/curator/run.json` + `REPORT.md` (paths exposed via `HermesPathSet.curatorReportJSON` / `curatorReportMD`). Surfaced in Scarf as a dedicated "Curator" sidebar item under Interact (between Memory and Skills) on Mac, plus a read-only iOS panel; both gated on `HermesCapabilities.hasCurator`.
- **5 new inference providers** — GMI Cloud, Azure AI Foundry, LM Studio (upgraded to first-class), MiniMax OAuth, Tencent Tokenhub. Mirrored in `ModelCatalogService.overlayOnlyProviders`; the model picker reaches all of them automatically.
- **`flush_memories` aux task removed** — `auxiliary.flush_memories` is gone from Hermes config. Scarf's `AuxiliarySettings.flushMemories` field is dropped; `HermesCapabilities.hasFlushMemoriesAux` returns `true` only on pre-v0.12 hosts so the row stays visible there.
- **`auxiliary.curator` aux task added** — Curator's review model is configurable independently of the main model. Surfaced in `Settings → Auxiliary` next to the other aux rows.
- **Multimodal ACP `session/prompt`** — ACP advertises and forwards image content blocks. Scarf chat composers (Mac drag/drop + paste; iOS PhotosPicker) attach images that flow through `ACPClient.sendPrompt(sessionId:text:images:)` as `[{"type":"text","text":...}, {"type":"image","data":"<base64>","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}]` — wire shape matches `acp.schema.ImageContentBlock`. `ImageEncoder` downsamples to 1568px long-edge JPEG q=0.85 detached (never blocks MainActor). Gated on `HermesCapabilities.hasACPImagePrompts`.
- **CLI additions:** `hermes -z <prompt>` (non-interactive one-shot), `hermes update --check` (preflight), `hermes fallback` (manage fallback providers), `hermes curator` (status / run / pause / resume / pin / unpin / restore), `hermes kanban` (full task-board CLI; multi-profile collab was reverted upstream so Scarf ships a read-only Kanban view only). All capability-gated.
- **Skills surface:** `hermes skills install <https-url>` direct-URL install (SkillsView "Install from URL…" toolbar button), reload via `hermes skills audit` (Skills "Reload" button — equivalent to the `/reload-skills` slash command for non-ACP contexts), enabled/disabled state read from `skills.disabled` in config.yaml (rendered as strikethrough + "OFF" pill), Curator pin badge from `~/.hermes/skills/.curator_state` (rendered as a pin glyph). The disable-toggle write path is deferred to v2.7 — Hermes only exposes `hermes skills config` as an interactive verb, and Scarf prefers reading accurately to risking a clobbered list.
- **Two new gateway platforms:** Microsoft Teams (19th, plugin-shipped) + Tencent 元宝 / Yuanbao (18th, native). Surfaced in the Mac Platforms tab.
- **Cron upgrades:** per-job `--workdir <abs-path>` (project-aware cwd that pulls AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / .cursorrules) is exposed in the editor sheet. Hermes also added a `context_from` field for chaining cron outputs but only via YAML so far — Scarf reads it (HermesCronJob.contextFrom) but doesn't write it.
- **Settings deltas:** `prompt_caching.cache_ttl` (5m/1h picker), `redaction.enabled` toggle (off-by-default in v0.12 — toggle restores it), `agent.runtime_metadata_footer` toggle, Piper added to TTS provider list, `vercel` added to terminal backend list.
- **Bundled plugins:** Spotify, Google Meet, Langfuse observability, hermes-achievements (visible in Plugins tab).
- **`hermes memory` providers:** honcho, openviking, mem0, hindsight, holographic, retaindb, byterover. `Settings → Memory` lists all providers in the picker; the existing "Run `hermes memory setup` in Terminal" hint stays — `hermes memory setup` is interactive (asks for tokens) so an in-app shellout would surface a frozen UI.
- **Schema is unchanged from v0.11** — same state.db columns (`messages.reasoning_content`, `sessions.api_call_count` introduced in v0.11 remain). No migration needed.

**v2026.4.23 (v0.11.0)** added (historical context, still consumed by Scarf when running against a pre-v0.12 host):

- `/steer <prompt>` — non-interruptive mid-run guidance slash command. Surfaced in Scarf chat menus via `RichChatViewModel.nonInterruptiveCommands`; `ChatViewModel.sendViaACP` (Mac) and `ChatController.send` (iOS) skip the "Agent working…" status flip and show a transient toast instead.
- New CLI subcommands: `hermes plugins` / `profile` / `webhook` / `insights` / `logs` / `memory reset` / `completion` / `dashboard`. Scarf v2.5 adopts **`hermes memory reset`** (toolbar button on MemoryView with destructive confirmation). The other CLIs are documented here for v2.6 — Scarf still reads `~/.hermes/plugins/`, `~/.hermes/profiles/` etc directly today; switching those paths to the canonical CLI is a forward-compatible change to make when bandwidth permits.
- New state.db columns: `messages.reasoning_content` + `sessions.api_call_count`. `HermesDataService.detectSchema` flips `hasV011Schema` only when both are present (partial migrations stay on v0.7 path). Surfaced as the "API" chip on session rows + a network-icon counter in DashboardView. `HermesMessage.preferredReasoning` picks the newer column when both reasoning channels are populated.
- New skills: `design-md` (Google's DESIGN.md authoring; needs `npx`/Node 18+ on host — checked via `SkillPrereqService` and surfaced as a yellow banner) and `spotify` (OAuth via `hermes auth spotify` — driven by `SpotifyAuthFlow` + `SpotifySignInSheet`, mirroring v2.3 Nous Portal pattern).
- Updated skills: `research-paper-writing` 1.1.0 (+SciencePlots dep), `segment-anything-model` (expanded docs), `google-workspace` (gws CLI prefer + granular OAuth scopes), `hermes-agent` (in-tree).
- SKILL.md frontmatter gains `allowed_tools` / `related_skills` / `dependencies` lists. `HermesSkill` carries them as optional fields; `SkillsView` (Mac) + `SkillDetailView` (iOS) render them as chip rows when populated.

v0.10.0 introduced the **Tool Gateway** — paid Nous Portal subscribers route web search, image generation, TTS, and browser automation through their subscription without separate API keys. In Scarf:

- **Provider picker** ([ModelCatalogService.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/ModelCatalogService.swift)) merges Hermes's `HERMES_OVERLAYS` so Nous Portal and other overlay-only providers (OpenAI Codex, Qwen OAuth, Google Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot ACP, Arcee) appear alongside the models.dev catalog. Subscription-gated providers sort first and render a "Subscription" pill.
- **Subscription detection** ([NousSubscriptionService.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/NousSubscriptionService.swift)) reads `~/.hermes/auth.json` → `providers.nous`. Read-only; Hermes owns the write path.
- **Per-task routing** (Auxiliary tab) toggles `auxiliary.<task>.provider` between `nous` and `auto`. Hermes derives gateway routing from provider selection — there is no separate `use_gateway` key.
- **Health surface** ([HealthViewModel.swift](scarf/scarf/Features/Health/ViewModels/HealthViewModel.swift)) adds a synthetic "Tool Gateway" section showing subscription state + `platform_toolsets` mappings + which aux tasks are routed through Nous.
- **Scarf's existing `Gateway` feature is renamed to "Messaging Gateway"** everywhere user-facing to disambiguate from the new Tool Gateway. The `SidebarSection.gateway` enum case and `gateway_state.json` / `gateway.log` paths are unchanged (not user-facing strings).

**Keep `ModelCatalogService.overlayOnlyProviders` in sync** with `HERMES_OVERLAYS` in `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/hermes_cli/providers.py`. When Hermes adds a new overlay-only provider, mirror the entry (display name, base URL, auth type, subscription-gated flag, doc URL) or the picker won't reach it.

## Project Templates

Scarf ships a `.scarftemplate` format (v1 as of 2.2.0) for sharing pre-packaged projects across users and machines. A bundle is a zip containing:

- `template.json` — manifest (id, name, version, `contents` claim)
- `README.md` — shown in the install preview sheet
- `AGENTS.md` — required; the [Linux Foundation cross-agent instructions standard](https://agents.md/) — every template is agent-portable out of the box
- `dashboard.json` — copied to `<project>/.scarf/dashboard.json`
- `instructions/…` — optional per-agent shims (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- `skills/<name>/…` — optional; installed to `~/.hermes/skills/templates/<slug>/` (namespaced so uninstall is `rm -rf` on one folder)
- `cron/jobs.json` — optional; registered via `hermes cron create` with a `[tmpl:<id>] …` name prefix and immediately paused
- `memory/append.md` — optional; appended to `~/.hermes/memories/MEMORY.md` between `<!-- scarf-template:<id>:begin/end -->` markers

Key services: [ProjectTemplateService.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/ProjectTemplateService.swift) (inspect + validate + plan), [ProjectTemplateInstaller.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/ProjectTemplateInstaller.swift) (execute a plan), [ProjectTemplateExporter.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/ProjectTemplateExporter.swift) (build a bundle from a project), [ProjectTemplateUninstaller.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/ProjectTemplateUninstaller.swift) (reverse an install using the lock file). UI in [Features/Templates/](scarf/scarf/Features/Templates/). The `scarf://install?url=<https URL>` deep link + `file://` URLs for `.scarftemplate` files are handled by [TemplateURLRouter.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/TemplateURLRouter.swift) and `onOpenURL` in `scarfApp.swift`. A `<project>/.scarf/template.lock.json` uninstall manifest is written after every install and drives the uninstall flow.

**Uninstall semantics:** driven by the lock file. Only files listed in `lock.projectFiles` are removed from the project dir; user-added files (e.g. a `sites.txt` created on first run) are preserved. If every file in the dir was installed by the template, the dir is removed too; otherwise the dir stays with just the user's files. Skills namespace is always removed wholesale (it's isolated). Cron jobs are removed via `hermes cron remove <id>` after resolving each lock-recorded name. Memory block is stripped between the `begin`/`end` markers, leaving the rest of MEMORY.md intact. No "undo" — uninstall is destructive; to re-install, run the install flow again. Uninstall UI lives on the project-list context menu and the dashboard header (only shown when the selected project has a lock file).

**Never** let a template write to `config.yaml`, `auth.json`, sessions, or any credential path — the v1 installer refuses. If you extend the format, treat the preview sheet as load-bearing: the user's only trust boundary is that the sheet is honest about everything that's about to be written.

### Template configuration (v2.3, schemaVersion 2)

Templates can declare a typed configuration schema in `template.json`'s new `config` block. The installer renders a **Configure** step between the parent-directory pick and the preview sheet; values land at `<project>/.scarf/config.json` (non-secret) and in the login Keychain (secret). A post-install **Configuration** button on the dashboard header (shown when `<project>/.scarf/manifest.json` exists) opens the same form pre-filled for editing.

Manifest shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "contents": { "dashboard": true, "agentsMd": true, "config": 2 },
  "config": {
    "schema": [
      {"key": "site_url", "type": "string", "label": "Site URL", "required": true},
      {"key": "api_token", "type": "secret", "label": "API Token", "required": true}
    ],
    "modelRecommendation": {
      "preferred": "claude-sonnet-4.5",
      "rationale": "Tool-heavy workload — reasoning helps."
    }
  }
}
```

Supported field types: `string`, `text`, `number`, `bool`, `enum` (with `options: [{value, label}]`), `list` (itemType `"string"` only in v1), `secret`. Type-specific constraints (`pattern`, `min`/`max`, `minLength`/`maxLength`, `minItems`/`maxItems`) are optional. `secret` fields **must not** declare a `default` — the validator refuses.

Key services: [TemplateConfig.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Models/TemplateConfig.swift) (schema + value models + Keychain ref helpers), [ProjectConfigKeychain.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/ProjectConfigKeychain.swift) (thin `SecItemAdd`/`Copy`/`Delete` wrapper; the only Keychain user in Scarf today), [ProjectConfigService.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/ProjectConfigService.swift) (load/save config.json, resolve secrets, cache manifest, validate schema + values). UI in [Features/Templates/ViewModels/TemplateConfigViewModel.swift](scarf/scarf/Features/Templates/ViewModels/TemplateConfigViewModel.swift) + [Features/Templates/Views/TemplateConfigSheet.swift](scarf/scarf/Features/Templates/Views/TemplateConfigSheet.swift).

**Secret storage.** Keychain service name is `com.scarf.template.<slug>`, account is `<fieldKey>:<project-path-hash-short>`. The path-hash suffix means two installs of the same template in different dirs don't collide on Keychain entries. Values in `config.json` are `"keychain://service/account"` URIs — never plaintext. The bytes hit the Keychain only on form commit, so cancelling never leaves orphan entries.

**Uninstall.** `TemplateLock` v2 gains `config_keychain_items` and `config_fields` arrays. The uninstaller iterates each URI through `SecItemDelete` before removing the lock file. Absent items (user hand-cleaned) are no-ops.

**Exporter.** Carries the *schema* from `<project>/.scarf/manifest.json` through into exported bundles, never values. Exporting never leaks anyone's secrets. `schemaVersion` bumps to 2 only when a schema is forwarded; schema-less exports stay at 1.

**Catalog site.** [tools/build-catalog.py](tools/build-catalog.py) mirrors the Swift schema validator. Each v2 template's `template.json` is copied into `.gh-pages-worktree/templates/<slug>/manifest.json` and the site's `widgets.js` calls `ScarfWidgets.renderConfigSchema` to display the schema on the detail page (display-only — the form lives in-app).

**Schema is Swift-primary.** If `TemplateConfigField.FieldType` gains a new case, update in order: `TemplateConfig.swift` (model + validation), `tools/build-catalog.py` (`SUPPORTED_CONFIG_FIELD_TYPES` + type-specific rules), `widgets.js` (`summariseConstraint`), `TemplateConfigSheet.swift` (new control subview), tests on both sides. Schema drift between validator + installer is the kind of bug users only notice after shipping.

### Project-scoped chat + Scarf-managed AGENTS.md context (v2.3)

v2.3 adds a per-project Sessions tab and a "New Chat" button that spawns `hermes acp` with `cwd = project.path`. Session-to-project attribution is persisted in a Scarf-owned sidecar at `~/.hermes/scarf/session_project_map.json` — the ACP wire protocol has no project-metadata hook (extra params are silently dropped), and `state.db` has no cwd column, so the sidecar is Scarf's source of truth for "which project does this session belong to?" Managed by [SessionAttributionService.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/SessionAttributionService.swift); read by the per-project [ProjectSessionsView.swift](scarf/scarf/Features/Projects/Views/ProjectSessionsView.swift).

**Giving the agent project awareness.** Hermes auto-reads a context file from the session's cwd at startup — priority order `.hermes.md` → `HERMES.md` → `AGENTS.md` → `CLAUDE.md` → `.cursorrules`, first match wins, 20KB cap. We lean on that by writing a Scarf-managed block into `<project>/AGENTS.md` before opening the session. Service: [ProjectAgentContextService.swift](scarf/scarf/Core/Services/ProjectAgentContextService.swift). Block shape:

```
<!-- scarf-project:begin -->
## Scarf project context
_Auto-generated by Scarf — do not edit between the begin/end markers._

You are operating inside a Scarf project named **"<Project Name>"**. …

- **Project directory:** `<absolute path>`
- **Dashboard:** `<path>/.scarf/dashboard.json`
- **Template:** `<author/id>` v<version>    <!-- template-installed only -->
- **Configuration fields:** `field_a`, `field_b (secret — name only, value stored in Keychain)`
- **Registered cron jobs:** `[tmpl:<id>] <name>` — schedule …, currently paused|enabled
- **Uninstall manifest:** `<path>/.scarf/template.lock.json`  <!-- when present -->

Any content below this block is template- or user-authored; preserve and defer to it.
<!-- scarf-project:end -->
```

**Invariants.**

- **Secret-safe.** Block surfaces field NAMES, never VALUES. A project with a Keychain-stored secret shows `api_token (secret — name only, …)`; the Keychain ref URI and any plaintext value never appear. Auditable by `refreshListsFieldNamesNotValues` in `ProjectAgentContextServiceTests`.
- **Idempotent.** Two refreshes with unchanged state produce byte-identical output. The write is skipped entirely when no delta, avoiding file-watcher churn.
- **Bounded.** Everything outside the markers is preserved on every refresh. Template-author AGENTS.md content lives safely below the block.
- **Non-fatal.** `ChatViewModel.startACPSession` calls refresh with `try?` + log — a failed write doesn't block the chat from starting; worst case is the session loses project awareness.
- **Refresh timing.** Called BEFORE `client.start()` so the block lands before Hermes's session-boot context scan. Skipping this ordering = the agent sees stale context from the previous refresh (or nothing, on fresh projects).

**Template-author contract.** A template shipped via the catalog should include an `AGENTS.md` with the template's operational instructions. Authors leave the `<!-- scarf-project -->` region alone — Scarf populates it at chat-start time. Everything below is template-owned and preserved.

**Known caveat.** If any parent directory of the project contains `.hermes.md` or `HERMES.md`, those shadow the project's `AGENTS.md` (higher in Hermes's priority order). No fix in v2.3 — deferred to v2.4 pending user input on how to handle authored `.hermes.md` files.

## Template Catalog

Shipped community templates live at `templates/<author>/<name>/` (one level down — `templates/CONTRIBUTING.md` explains the submission flow for authors). The catalog site is generated from this directory and served at `awizemann.github.io/scarf/templates/` alongside the Sparkle appcast — the two coexist on the `gh-pages` branch but touch completely disjoint paths.

Pipeline:

- **Validator + regenerator:** [tools/build-catalog.py](tools/build-catalog.py) is stdlib-only Python (3.9+). It walks `templates/*/*/`, validates every `.scarftemplate` against its manifest claim (mirrors the Swift `ProjectTemplateService.verifyClaims` invariants), enforces a 5 MB bundle-size cap, scans for high-confidence secret patterns, checks `staging/` matches the built bundle byte-for-byte, and emits `templates/catalog.json`. Tested by [tools/test_build_catalog.py](tools/test_build_catalog.py) — 16 tests covering every validation path.
- **Wrapper:** [scripts/catalog.sh](scripts/catalog.sh) mirrors the `scripts/wiki.sh` shape with `check / build / preview / serve / publish` subcommands. `publish` runs a second-pass secret-scan against the rendered site before committing + pushing `gh-pages`.
- **Site source:** `site/index.html.tmpl` + `site/template.html.tmpl` are `{{TOKEN}}`-substitution templates. `site/widgets.js` (~300 lines of vanilla JS) is the dogfood — renders a `ProjectDashboard` JSON into HTML using the same widget vocabulary the Swift app uses, so each template's detail page shows a live preview of its post-install dashboard.
- **Install-URL hosting:** raw-served from `main` at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awizemann/scarf/main/templates/<author>/<name>/<name>.scarftemplate`. No per-template Releases ceremony.
- **CI gate:** [.github/workflows/validate-template-pr.yml](.github/workflows/validate-template-pr.yml) runs the Python validator + its own test suite on every PR that touches `templates/`, the validator, or its tests. Failures post a comment on the PR with the last 3 KB of the validator log.

Maintainer workflow on merge to main:

```bash
./scripts/catalog.sh build       # regenerate templates/catalog.json + .gh-pages-worktree/templates/
./scripts/catalog.sh publish     # secret-scan rendered output + commit + push gh-pages
```

Same cadence as `scripts/release.sh` (manual, auditable, no auto-deploy). Runs stay isolated: release.sh only touches `appcast.xml` on gh-pages; catalog.sh only touches `templates/` on gh-pages. Never push catalog output on a release cadence or vice versa.

**Schema is Swift-primary.** When `ProjectDashboardWidget.type` gains a new case or `ProjectTemplateManifest` adds a field, update Swift first, then mirror into `tools/build-catalog.py` (`SUPPORTED_WIDGET_TYPES`, `_validate_manifest`, `_validate_contents_claim`) so the web validator stays honest. The Python test suite's real-bundle test catches drift on the example template but not on the full widget vocabulary — add a synthetic fixture to `test_build_catalog.py` for any new widget type.
