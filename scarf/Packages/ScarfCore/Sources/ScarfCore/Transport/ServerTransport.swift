///
/// **Design rationale.** The services that read Hermes state (`~/.hermes/…`)
/// and spawn the `hermes` CLI all boil down to a handful of primitives:
/// read/write/list files, stat file attributes, run a process to completion,
/// spawn a long-running stdio process for streaming, take a consistent DB
/// snapshot, observe file changes. `ServerTransport` exposes exactly those
/// primitives so the same service code works against either a local
/// filesystem or a remote host reached over SSH.
///
/// The primitives are deliberately **synchronous where possible** (file I/O,
/// process `run` + wait) so services don't need to become `async` end-to-end.
/// Streaming stdio (log tail, ACP JSON-RPC) goes through the
/// `streamLines(...)` async-stream variant so `Foundation.Process` never
/// appears in the public protocol — that's iOS-unavailable and would break
/// the ScarfCore compile for the iOS app target.
